# Data Visualization and Analysis

# You can easily explore your data using visualization techniques:
df.hist(column='income', bins=50)

# Features sets
# Let's define features sets X.
df.columns

# To use scikit-learn library, we have to convert the Pandas data frame to a Numpy array:
X = df[['region', 'tenure','age', 'marital', 'address', 'income', 'ed', 'employ','retire', 'gender', 'reside']] .values  #.astype(float)
X[0:5]

# What are our labels?

# Normalize data
# Data Standardization gives the data zero mean and unit variance, it is good practice, especially for algorithms such as KNN which is based
# on the distance of data points:

X = preprocessing.StandardScaler().fit(X).transform(X.astype(float))
X[0:5]

# Import classifier library implementing k-neasrest neighbors vote.

# Accuracy evaluation
# In multilabel classification, **accuracy classification score** is a function that computes subset accuracy. This function is equal to the
# jaccard_score function. Essentially, it calculates how closely the actual labels and predicted labels are matched in the test set.

from sklearn import metrics
print("Train set Accuracy: ", metrics.accuracy_score(y_train, neigh.predict(X_train)))
print("Test set Accuracy: ", metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, yhat))

# Practice
# Can you build the model but with k =6?
k = 6
neigh6 = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors = k).fit(X_train,y_train)
yhat6 = neigh6.predict(X_test)
print("Train set Accuracy: ", metrics.accuracy_score(y_train, neigh6.predict(X_train)))
print("Test set Accuracy: ", metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, yhat6))

# What about other k?
# K in KNN, is the number of nearest neighbors to examine. It is supposed to be specified by the user. So, how can we choose right value for K?
# The general solution is to reserve a part of your data for testing the accuracy of the model. Then choose k =1, use the training part for
# modeling, and calculate the accuracy of prediction using all samples in your test set. Repeat this process, increasing the k, and see which
# k is the best for your model.
